<h1>Special Characters</h1>
<p>Since &lt;,&gt; and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called special characters to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use"&lt;" to represent it.
